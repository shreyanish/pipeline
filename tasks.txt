deep learning models to test roi directly -- codemag face recognition (work focused on face and not hand)
algorithms to convert roi to rppg -- 10 to 15 (5 from dl & 10 algo based)
add new and simpler matrices (over r_ratio)
update codebase modularly
print signals w output (check how to evaluate quality of rppg signal)
